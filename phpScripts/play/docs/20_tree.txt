a. WHERE TO UPLOAD
You (admin) should put things in movies and notes folder, possibly into thumbs as well (if server 
is not configured to make thumbs itself. Make sure movies and thumbs folders are writable by the php
as well, if you need that thumbs are generated on the server side.
a2. WHAT TO UPLOAD
Movie files must be valid flv or mp4 files than can be played via flash, for php streaming you need 
to take special care.

b. FILE NAMING
example1: file-x576y320.mp4
will play embeded as 576x320 px
example2: file2-stream-x512y384.flv
will play embeded as 512x384 px and will try to use so called fake-php streaming
(if the file cant be played via php streamer, the progressive download mode should automagically 
kick in - not tested much lately, avoid or take special care)

c. THUMBNAILS AND SERVER REQUIREMENTS
Server requirements to automagically generate thumbs are:
1. posix (win servers are not supported any more, use older versions of the script, if you need that)
2. mtn (http://moviethumbnail.sourceforge.net/), makethumb (included), imagemagick
makethumb says:
# put me in /usr/local/bin (or somewhere on the path)
#    php must be aware of the system path (php.ini?)
# i need mtn (http://moviethumbnail.sourceforge.net/)
#    /usr/local/bin/mtn
# and image magick installed
