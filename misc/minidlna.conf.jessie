# This is the configuration file for the MiniDLNA daemon, a DLNA/UPnP-AV media
# server.
#
# Unless otherwise noted, the commented out options show their default value.
#
# On Debian, you can also refer to the minidlna.conf(5) man page for
# documentation about this file.

# Specify the user name or uid to run as.
user=minidlna



# Path to the directory you want scanned for media files.
#
# This option can be specified more than once if you want multiple directories
# scanned.
#
# If you want to restrict a media_dir to a specific content type, you can
# prepend the directory name with a letter representing the type (A, P or V),
# followed by a comma, as so:
#   * "A" for audio    (eg. media_dir=A,/var/lib/minidlna/music)
#   * "P" for pictures (eg. media_dir=P,/var/lib/minidlna/pictures)
#   * "V" for video    (eg. media_dir=V,/var/lib/minidlna/videos)
# media_dir=/var/lib/minidlna

# Type and minimum level of importance of messages to be logged.
#
# The types are "artwork", "database", "general", "http", "inotify",
# "metadata", "scanner", "ssdp" and "tivo".
#
# The levels are "off", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info" or "debug".
# "off" turns of logging entirely, "fatal" is the highest level of importance
# and "debug" the lowest.
#
# The types are comma-separated, followed by an equal sign ("="), followed by a
# level that applies to the preceding types. This can be repeated, separating
# each of these constructs with a comma.
#
# The default is to log all types of messages at the "warn" level.
#log_level=general,artwork,database,inotify,scanner,metadata,http,ssdp,tivo=warn
