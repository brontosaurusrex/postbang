# linux voice podcast
mpv $(wget -qO- http://www.linuxvoice.com/podcast_ogg.rss | xml2 | grep -m 1 '.ogg$' | cut -d "=" -f 2)


# breakdown:
# - get xml < wget
# - convert to something easier for line tools < xml2
# - find first occurrence of line that ends with exactly only .ogg  < grep
# - get me the 2nd field if delimiter is "=" < cut ( or you could use:  grep -o 'http://[^"]*' )
